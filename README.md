CubeForce is a physics based game wich you need to shoot in the cubes to rotate and direct them to hole.

-When you hit the blocks, they explode in seconds.

-When you put a cube on the hole you win points and some time.

-All the blocks can be put in the hole(width or height is less than the hole).

-The objective is survive to max time as possible to make more points.

-The sounds were build in Bfxr: http://www.bfxr.net/
